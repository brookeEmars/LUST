  <h2>How It Began</h2>
  <p>The Ladies Uphill Ski Team started with a few friends in northwestern Vermont who had recently started skiing together and wanted to give the group an identity. We span 3 decades - in our 30's, 40's, and now 50's. We have different family structures, jobs, and other interests, but the love of the skin up, ski down, and celebration of it all brings us together.</p>
    <p>The group started as fun idea to identify us as ourselves, apart from the guys we ski with. But it has come to be so much more than that. It is a banner, a call to action, a welcome and encouragement to any women (and men) who want to join us in our enjoyment of this great sport.</p>
    <p>Uphill skiing and riding is not just for hot shot guy skiers. It is for all of us who enjoy being outside, want to test our abilities, and share the joy of the experience.</p>
    <p>Please share your trip experiences, ask questions, share your knowledge, offer and request meet-ups, and share pictures - we especially love to see the adventures our LUST hats go on!</p>
    <p>Welcome, we are thrilled you are now a LUST member!</p>
    <p>Julie, Janet, Danielle, Dawn, and Sheila</p>
